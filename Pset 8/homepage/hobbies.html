        <h1 class= "headers sansserif">Basketball</h1>
        <p class = "text"> I've been playing basketball since I was 8 years old and have loved the sport since. I played in travel leagues and on my high school team before college, but I recently have been playing more recreationally rather than competitively. Along with playing, I love to watch basketball games with my family and friends! I am a huge Lakers fan! </p>

        <h1 class= "headers sansserif">Music</h1>
        <p class= "text"> In my free time, I love to listen to music. My favorite genres are Hip Hop and Afrobeats and my favorite artist is J. Cole. I love listening to music because of the personal connection a certain song can have. I've also been getting very into creating music throughout these past months in quarantine. Although I'm not aiming to become the next big thing, creating music has been an avenue for me to further analyze and comment on the flaws in modern-day society.</p>
